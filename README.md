# PitDivine

## Introduction
PitDivine (a play to "a bit divine") is a program designed as an attempt to answer and explore 'What if?' race scenarios, for example: 'What if Ferrari hadn't fucked up Leclerc in Monaco 2022?'. This race strategy simulator utilizes real historical race data and basic machine learning models to predict optimal pit stop timing and tire strategy for any driver or circuit.

## Problem
Race strategy decisions in Formula 1 are complex â€” teams rely on real-time data, simulations, and intuition. For fans and students, this decision-making process is hard to visualize.
PitDivine solves this by:
Allowing users to simulate different pit strategies for any race,
Predicting outcomes (total race time, final position estimate),
Providing visual analytics on lap times, tire degradation, and stint performance.
